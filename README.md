# Gameboy-RPG-Framework

This project is a framework for making RPGs for the Gameboy. Included is an example game showing off some of the features of the framework.

### Prerequisites

All that is needed is a text editor, everything else is provided. I would recommend Notepad++, as the "GBz80.xml" file included allows Notepad++ to have syntax highlighting for z80 assembly.

## Playing the game
To start, launch bgb. Next find the file "Main.gb" in the folder Example game. Drag and drop the file onto bgb.

## Built With

* [RGBDS](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds) - The assembler and linker used
* [GBT Player](https://github.com/AntonioND/gbt-player) - The audio library used
